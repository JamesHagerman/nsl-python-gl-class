# Null Space Labs - Intro to Graphics - OpenGL + Python

This class was given at Null Space Labs on Jan 7th 2017 by jk

Not sure where all this code came from... this is just a way for me to put the code online for future reference.

## Install:

You'll need python 2.7 and pyglet installed for these:


```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pyglet
```

## The examples:

Example order is (I think):

```
basic/
color/
texture/
normals/
diffuse/
bump/
```

The first three (`basic/`, `color/`, and `texture/`) have a decent amount of notes... added by myself. They may be sparse, and I have some experience with shaders and opengl so they may be missing some things...

But it should at least get you started.
